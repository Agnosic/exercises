# Zad1

## Installation and example usage

I included binary program so you don't need to install elixir. If you wish to build it you need to install elixir 1.10 and run ```mix escript.build``` 

```
mix escript.build

./zad1 input.txt

```

There is an example output.txt in this folder showing the result of input.txt
